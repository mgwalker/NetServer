There was a time when I was writing servers in PHP a lot, which is absolutely a
thing you can do. But, I thought, what if I could do it in C++ for the
performance? Well, I'd done it in college and I remembered it being kind of a
pain, so I thought, ooh! I'll write a utility wrapper. And this is that.

I never used it for anything because (I'm pretty sure) I never actually finished
implementing it, but... you know, it's here, anyway.
